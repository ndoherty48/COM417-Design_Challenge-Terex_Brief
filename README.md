# COM417-Design_Challenge-Terex_Brief

Example solution developed during the Ulster University Design Challenge as part of COM-417. The solution was designed to simulate the type of system that would run on the Terex machine, as part of the weighting system. The solution was written in C++ and uses a random number generator to simulate the data coming from the system that we designed
